# Is Anagram

## Problem Statement

Given two strings `s` and `t`, return `true` if the two strings are anagrams of each other; otherwise, return `false`.

An **anagram** is a string that contains the exact same characters as another string, but the order of the characters can differ.

### Constraints
- `s` and `t` consist of lowercase English letters.
- `1 <= s.length, t.length <= 5 * 10^4`

## Examples

### Example 1
```plaintext
Input: s = "racecar", t = "carrace"

Output: true
```

### Example 2
```plaintext
Input: s = "jar", t = "jam"

Output: false
```
